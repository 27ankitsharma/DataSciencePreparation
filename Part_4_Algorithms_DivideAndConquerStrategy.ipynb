As a first step toward multiplying $x$ and $y$, split each of them into their left and right halves, which are $n/2$ bits long. For instance, if $x = 10110110_2$ (the subscript 2 means “binary”) then $xL = 1011_2$, $xR = 0110_2$, and $x = 1011_2 × 2^4 + 0110_2$. \n",

Writing $T(n)$ for the overall running time on n-bit inputs, we get the recurrence relation $$T(n) = 4T(n/2)+O(n)$$\n",
    "We will soon see general strategies for solving such equations. In the meantime, this particular one works out to $O(n^2)$, the same running time as the traditional grade-school multiplication technique.
