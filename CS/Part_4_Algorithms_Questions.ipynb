For instance, the interval $[3,6]$ represents the set $\\{3,4,5,6\\}$.

    "The running time is $O(n \\log n)$. Lines 8 through 11 take $O(n)$ time, and we recursively call the function on two instances of half the size. This gives the recurrence\n",

    "We prove, using induction on $n$, that given the list sorted by left endpoints, Recursive-Max-Overlap returns the largest overlap between any two intervals.\n",

    "*Base case:* For $n=1$, there are no two intervals, so the largest overlap is $0$. Line 5 correctly handles this.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Inductive hypothesis:* Recursive-Max-Overlap finds the largest overlap for lists of length at most $n-1$.\n",

    "*Inductive step:*\n",

    "- The highest overlap $L$ between two intervals in the left half\n",
    "- The highest overlap $R$ between two intervals in the right half\n",
    "- The highest overlap $C$ between an interval in the left half and an interval in the right half\n",
    "Then the answer must be the max of the three, and we return it. We must now prove that Recursive-Max-Overlap correctly finds $L$, $R$, and $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By hypothesis, Recursive-Max-Overlap works on all lists of length $<n$. Therefore, lines 6 and 7 correctly compute $L$ and $R$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the $C$ case, suppose $J_\\ell$ is an interval in the left half and $J_r$ is an interval in the right half, and let $I[n/2 + 1] = [x,y]$ be the middle element of the list. Since our list is sorted, the left endpoint of $J_r$ is at least $x$. Therefore the intersection of $J_\\ell$ and $J_r$ lies in $[x,\\infty)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now observe that the left endpoint of $J_\\ell$ is at most $x$, and so it does not affect the size of the overlap. In other words, we can replace the left endpoint of $J_\\ell$ with $x$ and nothing changes. Now if we hypothetically assume all left endpoints of the left intervals are $x$, it is clear that the best choice of $J_\\ell$ the one that has the greatest right endpoint. Line 9 finds precisely this interval. We then we check its overlap with all intervals of the right\n",
    "half (lines 10-11). Our algorithm thus computes $C$, completing the proof.\n",

    "2. If $\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil - 1$, the least significant digit of the missing integer must be $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we discovered that the least significant digit of the missing integer is $c$. We can then ignore all positions in $A$ where there was a $1-c$ as the least significant digit (this can be done by creating an auxiliary array $B$ containing all the interesting indices we are considering in $A$, which can be created in $O(n)$ time).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice if we ignore those positions, and the least significant digits, we get the problem of finding the missing integer in an array of length $n/2$. Thus, we can recursively apply our algorithm to get a series of bits representing all but the last bit in the missing integer.
